 ## Links

Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another — enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing. 

You will commonly come across the following types of links:
- Links from one website to another
- Links from one page to another on the same website
- Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
same page
- Links that open in a new browser window
- Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone

### Writing Links
 Links are created using the < a> element. Users can click on anything 
between the opening < a> tag and the closing < /a> tag. You specify 
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

### Linking to Other Sites
< a>: Links are created using the < a>
element which has an attribute
called href. The value of the
href attribute is the page that
you want people to go to when
they click on the link. 

## Layout
We'll look at how to manage where each element on a page resides and how to construct appealing page layouts in this chapter.

This involves learning about how designing for a screen can be
different to designing for other mediums (such as print). In this
chapter we will:
- Explore different ways to position elements using normal
flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.
- Discover how various devices have different screen sizes
and resolution, and how this affects the design process.
- Learn the difference between fixed width and liquid layouts,
and how they are created.
- Find out how designers use grids to make their page
designs look more professional.

### Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

Each HTML element is treated as though it were in its own box by CSS. Either a block-level box or an inline box will be used for this box.

Block-level elements
start on a new line
Examples include:
< h1> < p> < ul> < li>

Inline elements
flow in between
surrounding text
Examples include:
< img> < b> < i>

## Functions, Methods, and Objects

We must provide browsers extremely specific instructions about what we want them to perform. As a result, long scripts might have hundreds (or even thousands) of lines. To structure their code, programmers employ functions, methods, and objects.
This chapter is broken down into three sections, each of which introduces:
- METHODS & FUNCTIONS: Functions are made up of a collection of statements that have been put together to accomplish a certain job. A method is similar to a function, except it is generated within (and is a component of) an object.

- OBJECTS: You learned in Chapter 1 that programmers use objects to construct data-driven models of the world, and that objects are made up of attributes and functions.
- BUILT-IN OBJECTS: The browser has a toolkit of objects that may be used to create interactive web pages.
### WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
Functions let you to combine a set of statements to execute a specified job. If various portions of a script do the same purpose, the function can be reused (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

### ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS & FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS 
Expressions yield a result. They're useful in situations when values are expected.
A function is considered as an expression if it is put where a browser expects to see an expression (for example, as an argument to a function).

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
Pair programming is the technique of two developers using a single workstation to collaboratively tackle a coding assignment. It's more like "two brains are better than one" than "stop reading over my shoulder." Pair programming is one of the ways we promote a collaborative atmosphere at Code Fellows while also learning important industry skills.
### How does pair programming work?

While there are many other types of pair programming, the Driver and the Navigator are the most frequent roles. The Driver is the sole programmer whose hands are on the keyboard and who is typing. The Driver is in charge of the “mechanics” of coding, including the text editor, file switching, version control, and, of course, writing code. The Navigator directs the Driver with their words but does not provide the computer any direct input. While checking for typos or errors, the Navigator considers the broad picture, what comes next, and how an algorithm may be turned into code.

### Why pair program?
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
