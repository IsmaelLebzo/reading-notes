# What is Wireframe?
-----------
### Definition of wireframe
**Wireframes:** are a simplified visual representation of a website's skeleton architecture. Wireframes are often displayed in black and white prior to the design and do not define any visual style, text, or images.

Website wireframes are sometimes likened to home plans. Blueprints specify the number of bedrooms, baths, and other rooms in your home, but they do not specify the color of the walls or the furnishings. Wireframes, on the other hand, specify the pages and functionality (e.g., forms, video, picture galleries, navigation, etc.) necessary to fulfill your website's goals.

### Why is wireframing important?
When creating a website, there are several factors to consider, including UI/UX trends, screen sizes and devices, and brand standards, to name a few. The wireframes provide a path for the designer (that's me!) to follow for pre-determined functionality and content that seeks to achieve a certain objective, saving time and money.
Some firms get right to developing the website after identifying the sitemap. This isn't good.
If you've just seen an outline of your new home, you wouldn't give the building crew the thumbs up to continue forward. Wireframes should be expected in the same way that blueprints are expected. Prepare for this process by mapping out your conversion strategy and how your website will guide consumers through the buyer's journey.

# HTML basics
**HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language): is the coding that organizes a web page's structure and content. Content might be organized using paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or pictures and data tables, for example. This tutorial will offer you a fundamental grasp of HTML and its purposes, as the title indicates.
