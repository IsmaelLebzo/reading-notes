# Markdown

**What is Markdown** :question:

Markdown is a web-based text formatting system. You have complete control over how the text appears; bolding or italicizing phrases, inserting photos, and making lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Markdown is mostly simply plain text with a few non-alphabetic characters like # or * tossed in for good measure.

*You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:*

5. Code: "if (isAwesome){
