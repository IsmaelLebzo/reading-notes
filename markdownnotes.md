**How you can benefit from a growth mindset** 

The growth mentality may open doors to more creativity and possibilities, as well as the ability to set higher objectives and attain them.

*What is a growth mindset* :grey_question:

A growth mindset holds that one's core skills may be developed via hard work and dedication; intelligence and talent are just beginning points. A passion of learning is linked with a development mentality.

**Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset**
1. Challenges

When I'm presented with a difficult coding challenge, I tend to focus on one element of it over and over until I conclude that it's impossible to solve or that I'm incapable of doing so. I put up my hands in surrender and come to a halt. To put it another way, I'm stuck in a mindset where I'm avoiding the problem by giving up.

2. Obstacles

When I reach a hurdle, my initial instinct is to switch my focus to something else. I lose attention, as seen by the graph above. I'll do anything to avoid staying at it and battling through the discomfort, whether it's clicking a tempting bookmark in my browser, popping out to get a cup of coffee, or just about anything else. This has been dubbed "immediate gratification monkey syndrome" by a coworker.

3. Effort

Cycling is a problem for me as well. When my alarm goes off at 5 a.m., the prospect of riding my bike is terrifying. The desire to stay in bed is strong, strong, powerful – curse you, immediate gratification monkey – but I know it won't last and, as always, I'll feel terrible afterwards. The cliched but accurate saying "no pain, no gain" encapsulates the development attitude perfectly!

4. Criticism

I also find it beneficial to reflect on each of my days and evaluate my performance. As I said at the outset, I frequently assess my days depending on my emotions at the conclusion. My worst days are when I haven't been able to get my act together, when I've procrastinated and squandered time, and when I have very little to look forward to.

5. Success of others

For a long time, I felt envious of those I considered to be more successful or clever. But, because to our open and honest culture, I was able to see how my work related to that of my colleagues, and how it all works together to produce something amazing.

**Growing at work, and outside work too**

I've had a fixed attitude way too many times, and I'm striving to alter that. Wisdom and accomplishment are the result of putting in hard effort rather than avoiding it. The monkey of quick satisfaction rests on everyone's shoulder in our culture. However, the rewards of perseverance and hard effort much surpass whatever the wicked chimp has to give.
