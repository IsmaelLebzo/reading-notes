 ## Lists
 There are several times when we must employ the use of lists. There are three main kinds of HTML:
-  Ordered lists: are lists that have a number assigned to each item in the list. For instance, the list may be a series of stages in a recipe that must be completed in the correct sequence, or a legal contract with each point marked by a section number.
-  Unordered lists: are bulleted lists that start with a point (rather than characters that indicate order).
-  Definition lists: consist of a list of words as well as definitions for each of those terms.
### Ordered Lists
1. < ol>
2. < li>
3. < ul>

## Boxes

You saw how CSS considers each HTML element as though it lived in its own box at the start of this section on CSS.
- Control the dimensions of your boxes
- Create borders around boxes
- Set margins and padding for boxes
- Show and hide boxes

When we look at page layout in Chapter 15, you'll see how to arrange these boxes on your pages once you've learnt how to manage their appearance.
 
 ## Box Dimensions
 width, height

 A box is sized to hold its contents by default. You may utilize the height and width attributes to customize the size of a box.

 ## Limiting Width
min-width, max-width

Some page designs adapt to the size of the user's screen by expanding and contracting. When the browser window is narrow, the min-width property provides the smallest size a box may be displayed at, while the max-width property gives the greatest width a box can expand to when the browser window is broad.

# JavaScript by JON DUCKETT Part III

![JavaScript](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RD5sE5BL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ciwuuuxvt9ew1sxd45hl.gif)

## ARRAYS

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't 
just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

When working with a list or a group of values that are connected to one another, you should consider utilizing an array.

### CREATING AN ARRAY

You create an array and give it 
a name just like you would any 
other variable (using the var or let
keyword followed by the name of 
the array). 
### VALUES IN ARRAYS

The values in an array are accessible in the same way as they would be in a numbered list. It's crucial to note that this list's numbering begins at zero (not one).

### EXPRESSIONS
A single value is returned when an expression is evaluated. There are two sorts of expressions in general.

### OPERATORS
Expressions rely on operators, which allow programmers to combine several values into a single value.

## SWITCH STATEMENTS 

The switch value is the first variable in a switch statement.
Each case specifies a potential value for this variable as well as the code that should be executed if that value is found.

### TYPE COERCION & WEAK TYPING

If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect, 
it tries to make sense of the operation rather 
than report an error. 

### TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES

Every value in JavaScript may be handled as if it were true or false thanks to type coercion, which has some intriguing side consequences.

### CHECKING EQUALITY & EXISTENCE 

Because it is considered truthy, the presence of an object or array is commonly used to validate the existence of an element inside a page.
