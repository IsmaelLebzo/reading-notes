Julia Rozovsky, like most 25-year-olds, had no idea what she wanted to accomplish with her life. She had previously worked for a consulting business, but it was not a good fit for her. Then she went to Harvard to work as a researcher for two professors, which was intriguing but lonely. Perhaps working for a large business would be a better fit. Perhaps a rapidly expanding start-up. All she knew was that she wanted to work in a more sociable environment. "I wanted to be a part of a community, something that people were creating together," she explained. She considered a variety of options — Internet startups, a Ph.D. degree — but nothing felt quite right.

When Rozovsky came on campus, she was placed in a study group that the school had deliberately designed to create close connections. Study groups have become a rite of passage for M.B.A. students, a method for them to experience working in groups and a reflection of the growing demand for employees who can negotiate group dynamics deftly. Today's worker could start the day by cooperating with a team of engineers, then send emails to colleagues promoting a new brand, then hop on a conference call designing a whole other product line, all while juggling team meetings with accountants and the party-planning committee.

Rozovsky and her four partners met every day between courses or after supper to discuss homework assignments, compare spreadsheets, and plan for tests. Everyone was bright and inquisitive, and they shared a lot in common: they had attended comparable universities and worked for similar companies. Rozovsky thought that their common experiences would make it easier for them to work effectively together. But it didn't work out like that. "A lot of individuals say their study groups are where they meet some of their greatest business school buddies," Rozovsky said. "It wasn't like that for me," she says.

The technology sector is not only one of our economy's fastest-growing segments; it is also becoming the world's dominating commercial culture. And certain self-mythologies and dictums lie at the heart of Silicon Valley: everything is different now, data rules supreme, and today's victors deserve to win because they are clear-eyed enough to dismiss yesterday's conventional wisdoms in favor of the disruptive and novel.

Assume that you've been asked to join one of two groups.
Team A is made up of people who are all extremely intelligent and accomplished. When you view a video of this group at work, you'll notice experts who wait until a topic comes up in which they're an expert before speaking at length on what the group should do. When someone makes an off-the-cuff remark, the speaker comes to a halt, reminds everyone of the meeting's agenda, and gets the group back on course. This group works well together. There is no idle chit-chat or lengthy discussions. The meeting concludes on time and disbands so that everyone may return to their workstations.
