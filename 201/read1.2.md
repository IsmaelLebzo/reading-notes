- Learning from other pages
_______
Firstly, thank you for picking up this
book. It has been written with two very
different types of people in mind:
- Those interested in learning how to design and construct websites from the ground up
- Anyone with a website (made with a content management system, blogging software, or an e-commerce platform) who wants more control over how their pages look.

## **Structure**

Many HTML and CSS books read like drab instruction manuals. To make it easier for you to study, we ditched the usual publisher framework and rebuilt this book from the ground up.

1. HTML The first chapter will focus on how HTML is used to generate web pages. You'll notice that you begin by jotting down the words that you wish to appear on your page. The words are then given tags or elements so that the browser knows what is a header, where a paragraph starts and finishes, and so on.

2. CSS is number two.
This part begins with a chapter that describes how CSS utilizes rules to govern the style and layout of web pages. Then we'll look at the various CSS attributes that you may utilize in your CSS rules.

## **Summary**

- The new HTML5 elements help define a web page's structure by indicating the function of various portions of it.
- When opposed to utilizing numerous div> elements, the new elements give cleaner code.
- It is necessary to inform older browsers that do not recognize HTML5 elements which elements are block-level elements.
- Extra JavaScript, which is available for free from Google, is required to make HTML5 components operate in Internet Explorer 8 (and previous versions of IE).

## **Introduction**

This book shows how browsers may be used to make webpages more dynamic, engaging, and user-friendly by using JavaScript. You'll also learn about jQuery, which simplifies the process of creating JavaScript.

1. Understanding the terminology used by JavaScript programmers to explain certain basic programming principles.
2. Learning the language itself, which, like other languages, necessitates a working knowledge of the vocabulary and sentence structure.
3. By looking at instances of how JavaScript is widely utilized in websites nowadays, you may have a better understanding of how it works.

## **The ABC of Programming**

You must first master certain fundamental computer programming ideas before learning how to read and write the JavaScript language. They'll be broken down into three sections:

1. What exactly is a script, and how can I write one?
2. How do computers interact with the rest of the world?
3. How can I create a web page script?

After you've mastered the fundamentals, the next chapters will show you how to utilize the JavaScript language to instruct browsers what to do.

### A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF INSTRUCTIONS

A script is a set of instructions that a computer may use to do a certain task.

### WRITING A SCRIPT 

To develop a script, first define your goal, then list the activities that must be done in order to accomplish it.
