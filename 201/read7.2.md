# Domain Modeling
![Domain Modeling](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/11/d8/dd/11d8dd9edc3393198046ca0598fed5c1.gif)
The process of building a conceptual model in code for a specific topic is known as domain modeling. The numerous entities, their properties and behaviors, as well as the constraints that control the problem domain, are all described in a model. An object-oriented model is a type of entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates activities in methods.

A well-articulated domain model can evaluate and validate multiple stakeholders' understanding of a given problem. It creates a vocabulary that may be utilized inside and between technical and business teams as a communication tool.

This is object-oriented programming in JavaScript at its most fundamental level.

1. The new keyword instantiates (i.e. creates) an object.
2. The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable.
3. The object is stored in a variable for later use.

## Calculate daily Likes

A video's popularity is measured in Likes. The number of viewers multiplied by the proportion of viewers who will Like a video is the formula for determining Likes. In other words, the number of viewers multiplied by the percentage.

To figure out how many people watch a video on a given day, pick a number between 10 and 30 and multiply it by the video's epic rating.

## Tables

A grid or table may be used to show a variety of different sorts of data. Sports scores, stock data, and railway schedules are just a few examples.
When displaying data in a table, consider in terms of a grid made up of rows and columns (similar to a spreadsheet). This chapter will teach you how to:

- When making tables, remember to use the four important parts.

- Tables may be used to represent complicated data.

- Tables should have captions added to them.

### What's a Table?

A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.
### Basic Table Structure
1. < table>
2. < tr>
3. < td>

### Old Code: Width & Spacing
There are several characteristics that should not be used on new websites since they are obsolete. However, you may run across some of these when going through older code, so I'll include them here. The usage of CSS has superseded all of these characteristics.

## CREATING OBJECTS USING CONSTRUCTOR SYNTAX

On the right, an empty object
called hote 1 is created using the
constructor function. 

Once it has been created, three
properties and a method are
then assigned to the object. 

(If the object already had any
of these properties, this would
overwrite the values in those
properties.) 

To access a property of this
object, you can use dot notation,
just as you can with any object. 

For example, to get the hotel's
name you could use:
hotel .name

Similarly, to use the method,
you can use the object name
followed by the method name:
hotel.checkAvailability() 

### ADDING AND REMOVING PROPERTIES

You can add additional attributes to an object after it has been formed (using literal or constructor notation).

This is done with the dot notation that you saw on pl03 for adding properties to objects.

Following that, the hotel object is given two more properties that display the facilities (such as if it has a gym and/or a pool). Boolean values are assigned to these attributes (true or false).

### RECAP: WAYS TO CREATE OBJECTS 

CREATE THE OBJECT, THEN ADD PROPERTIES & METHODS 

The object is generated on the first line of the code sample in both of these cases. After that, the properties and methods are added to it.

The syntax for adding and deleting properties and methods from an object is the same after it has been created.
