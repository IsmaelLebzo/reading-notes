## Images
Controlling the size and alignment of
your images using CSS keeps rules that
affect the presentation of your page in
the CSS and out of the HTML markup.

You can also achieve several interesting effects using
background images. In this chapter you will learn how to:
- Specify the size and alignment of an image using
- Add background images to boxes
- Create image rollovers in CSS
### AligNing images Using CSS

You saw how the float property may be used to shift an element to the left or right of its enclosing block, enabling text to flow around it, in the previous chapter.

Rather than using the < img>
element's align attribute, web
page authors are increasingly
using the float property to align
images. There are two ways that
this is commonly achieved:

1. The float attribute is applied to the class that was established to represent the picture size (in our case, the tiny class).
2. New classes are created with
names such as align-left or
align-right to align the images
to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in
addition to classes that indicate
the size of the image.

### Centering images Using CSS

By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block. 

You can specify class names
that allow any element to be
centered, in the same way that
you can for the dimensions or
alignment of images.

## Practical Information

To wrap up the book we are going to look
at some practical information that will
help you launch a successful site.

There are entire books written about each of the topics
covered in this chapter but I will introduce you to the key
themes that each subject deals with and give you pointers for
what you need to be considering. You will see:
- The basics of search engine optimization
- Using analytics to understand how people are using your
site after it has launched
- Putting your site on the web

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject.
The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can
improve your website's visibility on search engines.

- The Basics

Search engine optimization (or
SEO) is the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer
the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics
that your website covers.

- On-Page Techniques

On-page techniques are the
methods you can use on your
web pages to improve their
rating in search engines.

- Off-Page Techniques

Getting other sites to link to you
is just as important as on-page
techniques. Search engines help
determine how to rank your
site by looking at the number of
other sites that link to yours.

### On-Page SEO
There are seven important locations on each page of your website where keywords (words people could search for to reach your site) might appear to increase its findability.

1. Page Title
2. URL / Web Address
3. Headings
4. Text
5. Link Text
6. Image Alt Text
7. Page Descriptions
