## Text
When you make a web page, you add tags (also known as markup) to the content. 

These tags add more significance to the page and allow browsers to display the proper structure to visitors.

- Structural markup: The components that can be used to define both paragraphs and headers.
- Semantic markup: It gives you more information, such as where the emphasis is in a sentence, whether anything you wrote is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on.

### Headings
- < h1>
- < h2>
- < h3>
- < h4>
- < h5>
- < h6>

The contents of headers are displayed in varying widths by browsers. The contents of a h1> element are the most significant, whereas the contents of a h6> element are the least significant.
The size of the headers shown by each browser varies somewhat. Users can also change the font size in their browser. When we look at CSS, we'll learn how to adjust the size of text, its color, and the typefaces utilized.

### Paragraphs

To build a paragraph, use an initial < p> tag and a closing < /p> tag to enclose the words that make up the paragraph.

A browser will display each paragraph on a separate line with some space between it and any future paragraphs by default.

## Introducing CSS

In this section, we'll look at how to make your web pages more appealing by using CSS to manage their appearance.

CSS allows you to establish rules that govern how an element's content should be displayed. For example, you can specify that the page's background be cream, that all paragraphs be gray and typeset in Arial, and that all level one headers be in a blue, italic Times typeface.

### Understanding CSS

Imagine that every HTML element is surrounded by an invisible box to better understand how CSS works.

#### Example Styles

1. Boxes: Width and height
Borders (color, width, and style)
Background color and images
Position in the browser window

2. Text: Typeface
Size
Color
Italics, bold, uppercase, 
lowercase, small-caps

3. Specific: There are also specific ways 
in which you can style certain 
elements such as lists, tables, 
and forms.

## Basic JavaScript Instructions

You'll begin learning to read and write JavaScript in this chapter. You'll also figure how how to give a web browser instructions to follow.

### THE LANGUAGE: SYNTAX AND GRAMMAR 

As with any new language, there are new words to learn (vocabulary) as well as rules for how to put them together (grammar and syntax).

### GIVING INSTRUCTIONS: FOR A BROWSER TO FOLLOW

Web browsers (and computers in general) take a completely different approach to jobs than humans do. Your instructions should be written in a way that reflects how computers work.


Before moving on to more sophisticated topics in following chapters, we'll start with a few of the language's main building pieces and look at how they may be used to construct some very basic scripts (containing of a few simple steps).

## Decisions and Loop

When looking at a flowchart (for all but the most basic scripts), the code might take many paths, implying that the browser will execute various code depending on the scenario. In this chapter, you'll learn how to construct and regulate data flow in your scripts to deal with a variety of scenarios.

### Loops

There will be times when you will wish to repeat the same set of procedures.

### USING IF STATEMENTS
The if statement verifies (or evaluates) a condition. If the condition evaluates to true, the next code block's statements are performed.

### USING IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS 
The if...else phrase determines whether or not a condition exists. The first code block is run if it resolves to true. The second code block is executed instead if the condition resolves to false.

### USING SWITCH STATEMENTS
The switch value is the first variable in a switch statement. Each case specifies a potential value for this variable as well as the code that should be executed if the variable matches that value.
