## SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences

The majority of you are already familiar with SQL databases and are proficient in MySQL, Oracle, or other SQL databases. In recent years, NoSQL databases have become increasingly popular as a solution to a variety of business challenges.

Understanding the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as some of the various NoSQL databases, is beneficial.

## SQL vs NoSQL: High-Level Differences

- SQL databases are known as Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), whereas NoSQL databases are known as non-relational or distributed databases.

- For unstructured data, SQL databases have a preset schema, whereas NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema.

- MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres, and MS-SQL are examples of SQL databases. MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, and CouchDb are examples of NoSQL databases.

- When it comes to properties, SQL databases prioritize ACID qualities (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability), whereas NoSQL databases adhere to the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance )

## SQL Database Examples

1. MySQL Community Edition\
Replication: By replicating the MySQL database over many nodes, the work load may be significantly decreased, resulting in increased scalability and availability of the business application.
2. MS-SQL Server Express Edition\
Database mirroring, fail over clustering, and RAID partitioning are all included in the disaster recovery process.
3. Oracle Express Edition\
Although the scalability of this database is not as cost-effective as that of the MySQL server, the solution is extremely dependable, safe, controllable, and productive.

## NoSQL Database Examples

1. MongoDB\
Scalability: It is horizontally scalable, which means that instead of relying on a single resource, you may minimize burden by expanding the number of servers in your resource pool.
2. CouchDB\
Schema-less: As a part of the NoSQL family, it has a dynamic schema that makes it more flexible by storing data in the form of JSON documents.
3. Redis\
Redis delivers efficient data structures to the point that it is frequently referred to as a data structure server. Hashes, lists, strings, and sorted or unsorted sets can all be used as database keys.
