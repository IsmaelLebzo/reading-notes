## What Is Node and When Should I Use It?

So you've heard of Node.js but don't know what it is or how it fits into your development process. Maybe you've heard others sing Node's praises and are now thinking if you should learn it as well. Perhaps you're already familiar with another back-end technology and want to learn more about Node.js.

Continue reading if this describes you. In this post, I'll take a high-level look at Node.js and its major concepts from a beginner's perspective. Along the process, I'll look at Node's primary use cases, as well as the present status of the Node landscape, and provide you with a variety of jumping off places (for additional reading).

### What Is Node.js?

There are several meanings available on the internet. Let's take a look at a few of the most well-known ones. The project's home page reads as follows:

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

### Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine

Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, such as Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi, use the V8 engine, which is an open-source JavaScript engine. It was built with speed in mind, and it's in charge of converting JavaScript into native machine code that your computer can run.

When we state that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don't necessarily indicate that Node programs are run in a browser. They're not. Rather, Node's developer (Ryan Dahl) improved the V8 engine by adding capabilities including a file system API, an HTTP library, and a variety of operating system-related utility functions.

### Node Binaries vs Version Manager

Many websites may advise you to get the Node binaries for your system from the official Node download page. While it works, I recommend that you instead utilize a version management. This software allows you to install several versions of Node and switch between them at your leisure. Using a version management has a number of advantages. It eliminates potential permission concerns when using Node with npm, for example, and allows you to define a Node version per-project.

### What Is Node.js Used For?

Now that we know what Node and npm are and how to install them, we can go on to the first of their many applications: installing (through npm) and executing (via Node) different build tools aimed at automating the development of contemporary JavaScript applications.

On SitePoint, we have a number of articles about build tools. Here's a sample of some of my favorites:

- Webpack: A Beginner's Guide
- ESLint – the Pluggable JavaScript Linter — is up and running.
- Gulp.js: A Beginner's Guide
- Using Mocha and Chai, unit test your JavaScript.

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

Loops that repeat themselves. Review of the code. Quick response. Checking for errors and linting These are software engineering techniques that have been shown to significantly enhance the quality of code produced by developers. What if you could obtain all of this without having to type code line by line and character by character? Pair programming, a method used in many agile work settings, allows you to do so.

## How does pair programming work?

While there are many other types of pair programming, the Driver and the Navigator are the most frequent roles. The Driver is the sole programmer whose hands are on the keyboard and who is typing. The Driver is in charge of the “mechanics” of coding, including the text editor, file switching, version control, and, of course, writing code. The Navigator directs the Driver with their words but does not provide the computer any direct input. While checking for typos or errors, the Navigator considers the broad picture, what comes next, and how an algorithm may be turned into code. The Navigator may use their computer as a second screen to search for solutions and documentation, although this is not recommended.

## Why pair program?

Developers are likely to explore a variety of programming languages when learning to code. There are four essential skills that help anyone learn a new language, similar to those taught in a foreign language class: Speaking: utilizing the proper words to express a concept Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Reading entails figuring out what a piece of written language is trying to say. Writing: constructing a meaningful text from the ground up

Developers describe out loud what the code should accomplish, listen to others' suggestions, examine code that others have produced, and write code themselves in pair programming.

Code Fellows students focus on all four of these language-specific abilities over a five-hour partnered lab session. The skills students develop will benefit them in completing tasks, communicating and learning on their own, in interviews, and in preparing for a career in a firm that practices agile.

All of that? Wow. Let's have a peek, shall we?

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
