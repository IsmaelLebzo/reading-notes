**JavaScript** (JS): is a first-class compiled programming language that is lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled. While JavaScript is best known as a scripting language for Web pages, it is also used in a variety of non-browser contexts, including Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a single-threaded, prototype-based, dynamic language that supports object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) programming styles.

# Creating HTML is cumbersome
-----------
We had to utilize plus numerous times in such a simple HTML we intended to generate, and the code is illegible. Consider what would happen if we were to create a more complicated application with a list of objects or perhaps a table. It would be a pain to build HTML on the fly and then insert it into the DOM. 

People have faced the same difficulty in back-end systems built in Perl, Python, or Ruby, and the solution has been the invention of several templating engines. A template is essentially an HTML snippet with some placeholders, followed by a function call that takes the HTML snippet (the template) as an argument and returns many key-value pairs. The function then provides a new HTML snippet with the value of the relevant key in place of the place holders.

Similarly, there are several templating systems for JavaScript. HandlebarsJS, a JavaScript template engine, will be examined.
