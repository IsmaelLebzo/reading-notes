The process of building a conceptual model in code for a specific topic is known as domain modeling. The numerous entities, their properties and behaviors, as well as the constraints that control the problem domain, are all described in a model. An object-oriented model is a type of entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates activities in methods.

A well-articulated domain model can evaluate and validate multiple stakeholders' understanding of a given problem. It creates a vocabulary that may be utilized inside and between technical and business teams as a communication tool.

This is object-oriented programming in JavaScript at its most fundamental level.

1. The new keyword instantiates (i.e. creates) an object.
2. The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable.
3. The object is stored in a variable for later use.
